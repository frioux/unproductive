# unproductive

A tool for finding out how unproductive I really am.

## Description

Unproductive has two major parts.  The first part runs constantly and polls the
X server, extracting the title of the currently selected window and printing it,
along with the current timestamp, to standard out.  Expected usage is:

``` bash
$ unproductive | tee -a ~/x11-time.txt
```

After having that run for some time you can then run the report:

``` bash
$ report
      1 Work Chat
      2 ZR
     24 IRC Chat
     33 Signal
     43 Fun Project Dotfiles
    369 Fun Chat
    369 Fun Project Unproductive
    591 Chrome
    674 Firefox
```

The report is dead simple currently.  It does not yet take into account the
timestamps and only operates on all of the data at once, but once I find the
need to I expect to build out it's capabilities.

## Tips

For this to work well you need to set titles of your windows.  This mostly means
that terminal apps need to be configured a little.  I use tmux, so I needed to
put the following two settings in my `.tmux.conf`:

``` tmux
set -g set-titles on
set -g set-titles-string "#{session_name}:#{window_name}:#{pane_current_path}"
```

The first line tells `tmux` to set the title; the second changes the format to
something more useful than the default.

I also run `terminator` directly without `tmux` underneath.  In that case it is
worth directly setting the title.  Here's how I do that:

``` bash
$ terminator -e "vim -S $session" -T "vim:$session"
```

Other terminals will have similar settings and techniques.
