# unproductive

A tool for finding out how unproductive I really am.

## Description

Unproductive has two major parts.  The first part runs constantly and polls the
X server, extracting the title of the currently selected window and printing it,
along with the current timestamp, to standard out.  Expected usage is:

``` bash
$ unproductive | tee -a ~/x11-time.txt
```

After having that run for some time you can then run the report:

``` bash
$ report
      1 Work Chat
      2 ZR
     24 IRC Chat
     33 Signal
     43 Fun Project Dotfiles
    369 Fun Chat
    369 Fun Project Unproductive
    591 Chrome
    674 Firefox
```

The report is dead simple currently.  It does not yet take into account the
timestamps and only operates on all of the data at once, but once I find the
need to I expect to build out it's capabilities.
